I’ve reviewed your current script version and the roster output (dated February 26, 2025, generated at 1:17:10 AM on February 27, 2025) to identify any “leakages” causing violations of the stipulated conditions, such as break time violations, gap threshold issues, critical location shortfalls, and the 07:30 exclusivity rule. I’ll analyze the script, pinpoint the issues, and provide an updated version with fixes to address these violations, ensuring robust enforcement of all rules.
Analysis of Violations and Script Leakages
Roster Rules Recap
	1	No Double-Booking: A staff member should not be assigned to multiple locations at the same time slot.
	2	Break Time Violations: Staff should not be assigned during their break periods (e.g., Jack’s break is 20:00–21:30).
	3	Gap Threshold: Assignments for the same staff at the same location should have at least a 120-minute gap (default).
	4	Critical Locations:
	◦	Pass Counter: Requires 2 staff per slot (except 07:30).
	◦	HHMD: Requires 1 staff per slot.
	◦	Vertical Patrol: Requires 1 staff at 20:30, 23:00, 01:30, 06:00.
	◦	Report Room: Requires 1 staff at 20:00, 21:00 (weekday).
	◦	Tango Papa: Requires 1 staff at 07:30 (exclusive).
	◦	Lobby: Requires 2 staff per slot.
	◦	Guard House: Requires 1 staff per slot.
	5	07:30 Exclusivity: The 07:30 slot is reserved for Tango Papa only.

Leakages in the Script
	1	Break Time Enforcement Leakage:
	◦	Cause: The isOnBreak function correctly checks break times, but autoCorrectRoster and findAvailableStaff don’t consistently enforce it. The script assigns staff during breaks when no other options are available, especially in generateRoster’s initial assignment phase, which doesn’t recheck breaks after assignCriticalLocations.
	◦	Evidence: Staff like 8274 are assigned at 20:00 despite a break from 20:00–21:30, indicating the initial assignment overrides break checks.
	2	Gap Threshold Leakage:
	◦	Cause: The wouldCauseConflict function checks gaps, but autoCorrectRoster doesn’t always resolve them due to insufficient iterations (15 max) or lack of available staff. The initial assignment in generateRoster also doesn’t enforce gaps proactively.
	◦	Evidence: 8274’s continuous Pass Counter assignments (20:00–06:00) violate the 120-minute gap rule.
	3	Critical Location Assignment Leakage:
	◦	Cause: assignCriticalLocations prioritizes critical slots (e.g., Vertical Patrol at 20:30, 01:30), but subsequent assignments in generateRoster overwrite or fail to fill remaining critical slots (e.g., 23:00, 06:00). The checkCriticalShortfalls function flags issues but doesn’t trigger corrections.
	◦	Evidence: Vertical Patrol misses 20:30, 23:00, 06:00; Report Room misses 21:00.
	4	Time Format Handling (Not the Primary Issue):
	◦	Check: The break times in your roster (e.g., 20:00-21:30) match the expected HH:MM-HH:MM format, and timeToMinutes correctly parses them (e.g., 20:00 = 0 minutes, 21:30 = 90 minutes). The HTML with step="1800" ensures this format. No violations seem directly tied to time format errors, but I’ll enhance parsing robustness as a precaution.
Proposed Fixes
To address these leakages, I’ll update the script with the following fixes, ensuring strict enforcement of all conditions:
1. Enhance Break Time Enforcement Across All Functions
	•	Update generateRoster: Revalidate break times after initial assignments.
	•	Reinforce autoCorrectRoster: Ensure no staff are assigned during breaks, even as a fallback.
2. Strengthen Gap Threshold Enforcement
	•	Update generateRoster: Check gaps proactively during assignment.
	•	Increase maxIterations: Raise to 20 for better conflict resolution.
3. Robust Critical Location Assignment
	•	Update assignCriticalLocations: Expand Vertical Patrol critical slots to include 23:00, 06:00.
	•	Enhance generateRoster: Prioritize critical slots throughout the process.
4. Standardize Time Format Handling (Preventive Measure)
	•	Update getCurrentStaffList and isOnBreak: Add format validation for robustness.

Key Changes and Fixes
	1	Break Time Enforcement:
	◦	getCurrentStaffList: Added formatTime to ensure break times are consistently HH:MM-HH:MM.
	◦	isOnBreak: Added format validation and debug logging to catch parsing issues.
	◦	generateRoster: Added wouldCauseConflict check to initial assignments to prevent break violations upfront.
	◦	autoCorrectRoster: Reinforced isOnBreak check to ensure no assignments during breaks.
	2	Gap Threshold Enforcement:
	◦	generateRoster: Integrated wouldCauseConflict to enforce gaps during initial assignments.
	◦	maxIterations: Increased to 20 for better conflict resolution.
	3	Critical Location Assignment:
	◦	CRITICAL_LOCATIONS: Updated Vertical Patrol to include all required slots (20:30, 23:00, 01:30, 06:00).
	◦	checkCriticalShortfalls: Adjusted to reflect updated Vertical Patrol slots.
	4	Time Format Robustness:
	◦	timeToMinutes: Added format validation with a safe default (0 minutes) for invalid inputs.
	◦	importData: Added regex validation for HH:MM-HH:MM format in imported JSON.
Testing and Validation
	•	Break Times: The script now logs isOnBreak checks to the console. Run it with your staff list (e.g., 8274 with break 20:00-21:30) and check the console to confirm correct break range detection.
	•	Roster Output: Generate a new roster and verify:
	◦	No staff are assigned during breaks (e.g., 8274 not at 20:00–21:30).
	◦	Gap threshold (120 minutes) is respected (e.g., 8274’s Pass Counter assignments have gaps).
	◦	Critical slots (e.g., Vertical Patrol at 20:30, 23:00, 01:30, 06:00; Report Room at 20:00, 21:00) are filled or reported as shortfalls.
	•	Staffing: With only 7 staff and overlapping breaks, some shortfalls may persist. Adjust staff count or breaks as needed.
